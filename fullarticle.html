  <p><b>BILL COSBY IN COURT FOR HEARING AHEAD OF 'SEXUAL
   ASSUALT' RETRIAL</b> <br> 5th Mar 18 |</p>
  <p>Bill Cosby has appeared in court for the start of a pre-trial hearing 
     in his sexual assault case.The 80-year-old comedian entered a suburban 
	 Philadelphia courtroom on the arm of his spokesman.

	Cosby’s lawyers are trying to prevent dozens of accusers from 
	giving evidence at his April 2 sexual assault retrial. 
	Prosecutors want to call as many as 19 women to the witness box in an attempt to show Cosby engaged in a five-decade pattern of drugging and harming women.

	Cosby is charged with assaulting a former Temple University
	women’s basketball administrator at his suburban Philadelphia
	home in 2004. His first trial ended in a hung jury.

	Monday’s hearing comes less than two weeks after the death 
	of his 44-year-old daughter from kidney disease.</p>

  <h3>Urgent Product Recall</h3>
  <img src="img/tea.jpg" alt="img" style="width:30">
  <p><b>URGENT product recall issued for THOUSANDS of kettles</b>
  <br> 5th Mar 18 |</p>
  <p>Whirlpool have issued an urgent product recall for a line of KitchenAid kettles after it was found that the handle 
    could fall off and potentially cause you to burn yourself.
    The affected kettles were made during a four year period - 
    from January 2013 to June 2017.
	According to the Competition and Consumer Protection 
	Commission:

	"Whirlpool Corporation and its KitchenAid brand is 
	carrying out a voluntary safety campaign involving its
	‘KitchenAid electric 1.7L kettle’.

	The reason for this field action is that Whirlpool believes 
	the handle of the KitchenAid kettle can, in rare circumstances,
	separate from the upper attachment points to the kettle’s 
	body and become unstable.

	It is estimated that 1400 units of this product has 
	been distributed on the Irish market. Kettle colours 
	include: Red, Black, Silver and White/Cream.</p>

  <p><b>Emma Watson has shown off her new Time’s Up tattoo 
  – complete with grammatical error</b>
  <br> 5th Mar 18 |</p>
  <p>The Beauty And
  The Beast star, 27, was pictured at the Vanity Fair
  post-Oscars party in a black sleeveless dress.

But the large Time’s Up tattoo on her right arm was 
missing an apostrophe.It is not known whether the tattoo 
is a temporary or permanent inking.

Stars arrived on the red carpet at the Academy Awards
 wearing pins for the Time’s Up movement, which was triggered
 by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s downfall.

Last month, it emerged that Harry Potter actress 
Watson made a £1 million donation to a new fund that 
will help set up a framework and provide support for 
those affected by sexual harassment.

Watson was one of dozens of stars at the Vanity Fair bash,
 including Margot Robbie, Francis McDormand, Jordan Peele,
 Ashley Graham, Rita Ora, Gal Gadot and Miley Cyrus.</p>
